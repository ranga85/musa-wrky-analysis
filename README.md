Main goal of the study is to identify Musa WRKY gene family targeting mature miRNA from fusarium treated root transcriptomes. 

# Sources

* Published transcriptome data from NCBI Bioproject PRJNA485562 (Zhang et al. 2019). 

* Three samples are selected for bioinformatics analysis i.e. 
- Untreated roots (SRR7691543)
- Two weeks of dpi treatment with TR4 (SRR7691540)
- Two weeks of mock treatment (SRR7691539).
